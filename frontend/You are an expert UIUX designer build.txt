You are an expert UI/UX designer and we have started to building a Mission Appointment System (MAS) for Régie Nationale des Postes (RNP) - Burundi's government postal service.

CONTEXT was:
To Replace manual mission management with a digital platform featuring auto-assignment, multi-level approvals, and reporting.

With 6 User Roles:**
1. Employees - Accept/decline missions
2. Department Heads - Create missions, approve substitutions
3. Finance Officers - Budget approvals, reimbursements
4. HR Officers - Availability confirmations
5. Directors - Final approvals, strategic oversight
6. Admins - System configuration, user management

**Core Feature: Auto-Assignment Algorithm**
System assigns missions based on: qualifications match, department, fairness (prioritizes employees with no missions or oldest last mission), availability.

**Key Workflows:**
Mission Creation → Auto-Assignment → Employee Response (Accept/Substitute/Decline) → Multi-Level Approvals (Dept Head → Finance → HR → Director) → Post-Mission Reporting

## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Professional government aesthetic: Blue/green primary, orange alerts
- French language (labels: Tableau de bord, Approuver, Rejeter, etc.)
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessible, responsive (desktop-first)
- Clear status indicators, progressive disclosure
- Mock data: Burundian names, cities (Gitega, Ngozi), departments (Distribution, Logistique, Finances, RH), currency (BIF)
